## User goal
A user knows what the goal of their call is, even if they think they don't. Ask for more clarification if a user goal hasn't been defined yet. They have to help us first by describing the problem so we can identify a solution as quickly as possible.

Bad goal for a support call:
> I can't login to my account.

Good goal for a support call:
> I can't login to my account because I don't know where to go to login.

## Checklist
- Clarify the application the user intends to access. For *most* users, [Wialon Hosting](https://hosting.terminusgps.com/) is where they need to be.
- Confirm that the user has typed their intended `url` correctly.
- **Do not share passwords/sensitive information over the phone**, instead ask for a good email to email their credentials to.
> Even if the password is `Terminus*1`, don't share it over the phone. The phone is one of our least secure communication lines, assume that everything said over the phone **can** and **will** be read by either law enforcement or bad actors at some point. These call logs will **never** go away after they are created.
- Recommend that the user bookmarks [Wialon Hosting](https://hosting.terminusgps.com/) in their browser to easily return to it.
- Recommend the user a password manager, the Internet is unusable without them IMO.
